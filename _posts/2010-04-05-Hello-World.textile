Hello and welcome to my first post in a long while.  For the very few of you who have read previous incarnations of the iNK blot, things are likely to look and feel a little different around here.  

I'm all fired up to begin by cataloging my experiences thus far with ruby and rails.  I have been wanting to get to know these technologies for a while now and have finally found an opportunity to get on with it. Since December 2009 I have worked my way through a few books, tutorials and an online course, and, I am going to share my experiences in the next few posts.
