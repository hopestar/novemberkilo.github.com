h2. Books

If you are even slightly familiar with the scene I am sure you know that there very many books on Rails and quite a few on Ruby.  To be clear, I have not read most of them and am not in a position to comment on any beyond the few that I decided on.  I chose to start off with an introduction to Rails.  It was pretty clear that I would also need an introduction to Ruby and so I looked for a Rails book that provided this as well.  Having had some exposure to the excellent "Pragmatic Programmer":http://www.pragprog.com series, I was tempted to pick up "Agile Web Development with Rails.":http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition After all, one of the authors, David Heinemeier Hansson, is the creator of the Rails framework. I did buy this book eventually, but after a conversation with "@matthewsinclair,":http://www.matthew-sinclair.com it wasn't the book that I chose to get me started.  

I spent a bunch of time on Amazon reading reviews of Rails books and based mainly on what I read there, chose to start off with Patrick Lenz's, "Simply Rails 2.":http://www.sitepoint.com/books/rails2/  

Patrick's book is fun!  It is written in a relaxed style and concentrates on getting the beginner to the point where they have quickly built a simple Rails app (modelled on Digg).  It fits the ethos of Rails in that it provides near-real-time gratification and the reader is encouraged by the fact that they're getting their hands dirty and have something to show for it.  His here-hold-my-hand-while-we-connect-the-dots approach has the obvious problem of needing to gloss over the detail, but this is what this beginner needed so as to avoid getting bogged down early.  His chapter on Ruby basics is good, but basic. I read his book over a couple of sittings, working through the code that he presents and building the app that he uses to illustrate the main aspects of Rails.  

@matthewsinclair also recommended Michael Hartl's work-in-progress tutorial, deceptively named, ""The Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book."":http://railstutorial.org Michael's "bio":http://michaelhartl.com mentions his accolades as a face-to-face teacher at Caltech - from having taught for 8 years or so myself, I can say that he has managed to successfully cut his teaching abilities over to the written word.  For some reason I had decided to put off tackling Michael's tutorial until after I had finished Simply Rails 2 (well, I think at the time I just wanted to finish a task first).
