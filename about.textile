h1. About the author and this site
<br/>

h3. The Author

My name is Navin.  I live in Sydney, Australia.

I'm a Rails developer and I work in the education sector.  I'm also a retreaded mathematician, bioinformatics groupie, big data curioso and erstwhile information security bod. Sometimes (quite often), I'm a philosophical pessimist (which might not mean what you think it means).

I studied Computer Science when Z-80s and 6502s were the microprocessors of the day and the university lab splurged on a bunch of NeXT workstations (don't know what these are? Then read some "history)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mac_OS_X. My Operating Systems class involved group readings of the Unix kernel source. Some mathematicians on campus were nice to me once and 10 years later I found myself with a PhD in pure mathematics and a couple of publications to my name.

I have been around the block a few times, and live(d) a few very different lives.  These include:
* C Programmer
* Research mathematician and teacher
* ==PKI==, Identity and Trust afficionado
* Information security architect and consultant
* Senior manager at a consulting firm and at a financial institution

I like to learn - really a lot.

h3. The Site

I write here.  Topics include information and opinion relevant to my adventures as a technologist. I will not publish anything here of a personal nature.

This site hosted on "GitHub":http://github.com using their "Pages":http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages feature.  It is created using "Tom Preston-Werner's":http://tom.preston-werner.com/ excellent "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com static site generator. I get to write in textile or markdown, learn about design as I tweak the layout of the site, and, store everything in Git.  I will (if I haven't already) write about how I set up this site, and what services and tools play here.
