h1. The Author

My name is Navin.  I live in Sydney, Australia.  

I am a recent ruby enthusiast and I am happily curious about where this might take me.  I have been around the block a few times, and lived a few very different lives.  These include:
* C Programmer 
* Research mathematician and teacher
* Bioinformatics groupie
* PKI, Identity and Trust afficionado
* Information security architect and consultant
* Senior manager at a consulting firm and at a financial institution

I like to learn - really a lot.  

h1. The Site

I write here.  Topics include information and opinion relevant to my adventures as a technologist. I will not publish anything here of a personal nature.

As a result of my recent forays into development, I decided to build this site using ruby and other open-source tools.  I conciously decided not to use tumblr or posterous or similar ... and to see whether I can get to a point where I don't notice any productivity blocks resulting from "blogging like a hacker."  

So, I have chosen to have this site hosted on "GitHub":http://github.com using their "Pages":http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages feature.  The site is created using "Tom Perston-Werner's":http://tom.preston-werner.com/ excellent "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com static site generator. I get to write in textile or markdown, learn about design as I tweak the layout of the site, and store everything in Git, a version control system that I am getting to know well.  I've used "Alex Payne's":http://al3x.net site as a starting point - I like the simplicity of its structure, style and appearance.
